# My Blog
The idea behind making a blog, that too from scratch is to have a repository of
all the thoughts and ideas that, I have had or might have. I would ideally want this
also to be a portfolio of sorts, but that is only the secondary objective. The primary one
is to record thoughts and ideas.

### TO DO :

* Sticky navbar
* add images
* figure out design
    * The whole theme and stuff
